<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Using the provided data source of dresses, update the python file <b>"run.py"</b> that generates 100 recommended dresses for the users represented in "trisha.json" and "emily.json"</p>
<p>These 100 dresses should be ranked from most to least similar to their preferences, and show some similarity to the dresses in each users "last_saved_dresses" field. </p>
<p>The output should be 4 files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>trisha.txt <= a list of wardrobe ids, ordered from most to least similar to their preferences. There is an example in "example_output.txt" </li>
  <li>trisha.html <= a visual representation of trisha.txt. There is an example in "example_output.html"</li>
